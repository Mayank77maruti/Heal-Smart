## Design Idea & Approach


### Architecture
<p align="center">
    <img src="screenshots/architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture"  width="600" height="329">
</p>

HealSmart offers a comprehensive healthcare solution by leveraging modern technologies and user-friendly design principles. The architecture is built around three main divisions:

1. **Symptom Analysis:** HealSmart diagnoses diseases based on symptoms using a Flask API connected to a trained ML model. The predicted disease is received as a response from the API, and then it guides users to the appropriate specialist doctor for further consultation. Additionally, there's an AI-driven chatbot, developed using the Gemini API, which offers preliminary suggestions based on the symptoms and disease.
2. **Mind-Bot:** To address mental health concerns, I developed a chat application powered by the Gemini API from Google AI Studio. The Gemini 1.5 pro model is feeded with system instructions and trained with some conversations to provide empathetic consultations. This chatbot provides support for mental health issues like loneliness and anxiety and also offers suggestions on how to handle them effectively.

3. **Consult Doctor:** HealSmart enables users to find and book appointments with doctors across various specialties. Data is fetched from Firebase Firestore, where dummy healthcare provider datas are maintained. Users can explore doctors' profiles, view their basic details and ratings, and check for their availability. This feature streamlines the process of finding and scheduling appointments, enhancing the overall healthcare experience for users.


### Data Set Desciption

After searching online, I discovered a Kaggle dataset that fits our 'Symptom Analysis' recommendation system. The dataset comprises 133 columns: 132 for patient symptoms and 1 for prognosis. It covers 42 different diseases and illnesses. The 'training.csv' file contains a total of 4,920 rows.

### Machine Learning Lifecycle

<p align="center">
    <img src="screenshots/ml_lifecycle.jpeg" alt="ML Lifecycle" width="600" height="379">
</p>

The machine learning lifecycle begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset, consisting of 132 columns of categorical data (0 or 1), covered 42 diseases, each with 120 balanced samples. We ensured data consistency, corrected naming inconsistencies, and focused on 12 diseases for prototyping.

Utilizing techniques like Tree-based Algorithm for Feature Importance, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and L1 Regularization (Lasso), I reduced features to 60 for simplicity. After excluding irrelevant rows and introducing a new class for uncorrelated symptoms, the dataset contained 1,560 rows and 61 columns.

I divided the dataset into X (60 columns) and Y (1 column) and applied an 80:20 train-test split, stratified to maintain equal class representation. Using Logistic Regression from sklearn, my model achieved a 99% validation accuracy, effectively addressing the multi-class classification problem.



## Getting Started
